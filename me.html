			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm Shelby.  I'm a TAM minor in my last semester as an undergrade here at CU.  I'm also majoring in English with an emphasis in creative writing.  Something interesting about me... I'm on CU's Quidditch team (yes, this is a real thing), and I used to be a competitive saber fencer, so I guess I'm into unusual sports. </p>

			<p>Funnily enough, I actually started teaching myself HTML when I was in 6th grade on neopets of all places.  You had to use html to edit your pet's pages, and I had no idea what I was doing, but somehow managed to figure some stuff out on my own.  Here at CU I've taken the WEB class and the Front End Web Development class, so most of my web skills are from there.  I like learning ways to make websites more interractive and interesting.  I like it when there are moving parts. </p>

			<p>In this class I'm mostly just generally wanting to know more about the kind of tools web developers use because I don't have a lot of experience with those things.  I'm also really interested to learn about Wordpress, and super excited about the parallax scrolling because I think that stuff looks so cool. </p>
